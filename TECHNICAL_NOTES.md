# Technical Documentation - RaceResult Web API Client

**Project**: @sptiming/rr-webapi  
**Initial Development**: 2025  
**Original Authors**: SPTiming Team  

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Modular Endpoint Design (Original Implementation: 2025)

**Innovation**: Separated API functionality into distinct endpoint classes rather than monolithic approach.

**Technical Approach**:
- `PublicApi` - Authentication and public operations
- `EventApi` - Event-specific operations  
- `DataApi` - Participant data management
- `RawDataApi` - Timing data access
- `ContestsApi` - Contest management

**Rationale**: Improves maintainability, testing, and allows selective importing of functionality.

### 2. TypeScript-First API Design

**Innovation**: Complete type safety for RaceResult API interactions.

**Implementation Details**:
- Comprehensive interface definitions for all API responses
- Generic type parameters for flexible data handling
- Compile-time validation of API requests/responses

### 3. Promise-Based Async Architecture

**Design Decision**: Full async/await support with proper error handling chains.

**Implementation**: 
- All API calls return typed Promises
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Chainable operations for complex workflows

## Prior Art Establishment
